1. Define the problem
State representation: Set of 5 tuples where each tuple maps a limb to a hold and finally a hip to a discrete location

Limb is one of:
1. LH
2. RH
3. LF
4. RF
5. hip

Hold is one of:
1. Rock
2. Volume
3. Wall

Action representation: 
1. A limb moves to another hold (ideally one it hasn't seen before, check in explored set)
2. Flag left/right foot
3. Mantle
4. Drop left/right knee
5. Bathang lol

Cost function: dependent of difficulty of move
